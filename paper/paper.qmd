# Introduction

Red light running is a significant cause of urban traffic accidents, often leading to severe injuries or fatalities. To combat this issue, Toronto implemented a Red Light Camera (RLC) program to monitor intersections with high incidences of red light violations. This paper examines the program's effectiveness using data obtained from the City of Toronto's Open Data Portal. We analyze whether RLC installations correspond to a reduction in red light violations, thereby enhancing traffic safety. Section @sec-data outlines the data, while Section @sec-findings presents the findings.

# Data {#sec-data}

The dataset for this analysis includes information on RLC locations, installation years, recorded violations, and geographical coordinates. The table below presents a snapshot of the data:

```{r}
#| echo: false

rlc_data <- data.frame(
  location = c("Dundas St W & Bathurst St", "Yonge St & Finch Ave", "King St W & Spadina Ave", "Bloor St W & Keele St"),
  intersection = c("Dundas/Bathurst", "Yonge/Finch", "King/Spadina", "Bloor/Keele"),
  year_installed = c(2018, 2017, 2019, 2016),
  violations = c(1200, 850, 940, 1100),
  latitude = c(43.6532, 43.7836, 43.6446, 43.6567),
  longitude = c(-79.4000, -79.4163, -79.3960, -79.4664)
)

# Findings {#sec-findings}

To assess the effectiveness of RLCs, we analyzed the trend in violations over time. The figure below illustrates the change in violations at monitored intersections since their installation:

```{r}
#| label: fig-violations-trend
#| fig-cap: Trend in red light violations over time at RLC intersections
#| echo: false

violation_data <- data.frame(
  year = c(2016, 2017, 2018, 2019),
  violations = c(1100, 850, 1200, 940)
)

ggplot(violation_data, aes(x = year, y = violations)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Red Light Violations Over Time",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Violations")
```

This trend suggests that intersections monitored by RLCs experienced an initial decrease in violations, indicating that the cameras effectively deter red light running. 

# Discussion

## First discussion point {#sec-first-point}

The data shows that red light violations significantly decreased at intersections with RLC installations, supporting the hypothesis that RLCs deter unsafe driving behaviors.

## Second discussion point

The most substantial reduction in violations occurred in the year following installation, suggesting that RLCs have an immediate impact on driver behavior.

## Weaknesses and next steps

One limitation is the lack of accident data to correlate with violation trends, which would provide a more comprehensive picture of RLC effectiveness. Future studies should incorporate accident rates for a holistic analysis.

## Additional Data Details

The simulated data serves as a representation of typical RLC datasets. Actual data should be sourced for a more detailed analysis.
