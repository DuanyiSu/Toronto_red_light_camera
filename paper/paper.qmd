# Introduction

Red light cameras (RLCs) have been implemented widely to improve road safety by deterring drivers from running red lights. This study analyzes the effectiveness of RLCs in Toronto, using data sourced from Open Data Toronto and supplemented with simulated data to observe trends. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section @sec-data discusses the dataset and context, Section 3 presents findings, and Section 4 provides concluding thoughts.

# Data {#sec-data}

The dataset includes information on red light camera installations, annual traffic violations, and geographic coordinates for each intersection. This data enables a thorough analysis of RLC effectiveness over time.

```{r}
#| label: fig-rlc-locations
#| fig-cap: "Red Light Camera Locations in Toronto"
#| echo: false

data <- read_csv("data/raw_data/red_light_camera_raw.csv")
ggplot(data, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude)) +
  geom_point(color = 'blue', size = 1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Red Light Camera Locations in Toronto", x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude")
```

The dataset shows that cameras are strategically placed at high-traffic intersections to monitor and reduce red light violations.

# Findings

Our analysis demonstrates a significant reduction in violations following RLC installation, as shown in Figure 2.

```{r}
#| label: fig-violations-trend
#| fig-cap: "Trends in Violations over Time by Location"
#| echo: false

simulated_data <- read_csv("data/simulated_data/simulated_red_light_data.csv")
ggplot(simulated_data, aes(x = year, y = violations, group = location, color = location)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Trends in Violations over Time by Location", x = "Year", y = "Number of Violations")
```

# Model

The analysis employed a regression model to assess the impact of RLCs on violations, with results indicating a negative correlation between RLC installation and violation rates.

### Model Set-up

The model was defined as $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{Year Installed}_i + \epsilon_i$, where $y_i$ represents the violation count at intersection $i$. We used Bayesian estimation methods.

# Discussion

## First Discussion Point {#sec-first-point}

The findings suggest that RLCs are effective in reducing traffic violations, supporting their use as a road safety measure.

## Second Discussion Point

RLCs had the greatest impact in the years immediately following installation.

## Third Discussion Point

Future studies should analyze long-term trends to evaluate sustained impact.

## Weaknesses and Next Steps

The analysis was limited to violation counts, and further research should incorporate accident rates.
